What we need is to have the "Fight Him" option run the round(); function and build a runAway() function as well as a robinMelee() option, to give the player advice on how to melee/what he would do in this situation. (Can have robin say "I don't know Batman, its your call" sometimes).

	The problem here is now if webhelper.js is apart of the melee.html, it will loop to index. But if it's not there, the setup(); function in webhelper will not work, which is causing the cases for "Fight Him","Run Away", and "Ask Robin" to NOT WORK. 

	OPTIONS{
		New file, call meleeHelper.js?
		fix webhelper.js?
	}
}
